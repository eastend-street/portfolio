## What is Jot down?

Jot down is a bookmark and note web service. You can save some your favorite website or article to Jot down. Also you can write a note with your bookmark.

## Why I created this app

To manage a lot of bookmarks easily. I have been using chrome bookmark manager but sometimes I can't find the bookmark that I'm looking for. Then I often commented on bookmarks and saved them in slack to remember what bookmark is. But also difficult to find it again. Jotdown was born to solve these problems.

## Technologies

I developed all of the service, front end, back end, infrastructure and design. In front end, using React, Redux and styled-components that realized correct style application and state management. In back end, using Django REST framework, Docker, Heroku that established RESTful API communication.

- Front-end: React.js, Redux, styled-components, Material-ui
- Backend: Django REST framework, Python
- Infrastructure: Docker, Heroku
- Others: REST API, Axios, Gunicorn, Netlify
