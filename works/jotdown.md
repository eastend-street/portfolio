## What is Jot down?

Jot down is a bookmark and note web service. You can save your favorite websites or articles to Jot down. Also, you can write a note with your bookmarks.

## Why I created this app

To manage a lot of bookmarks easily. I had been using Chrome bookmark manager but sometimes I couldn't find the bookmark that I was looking for. Also, I wanted to write a note with bookmarks to remember what the bookmarks are, but Chrome bookmark manager doesn't have that. To solve these problems, I made Jotdown.
