## What is Jot down?

Jot down is a bookmark and note web service. You can save some your favorite website or article to Jot down. Also you can write a note with your bookmark.

## Why I created this app

To manage a lot of bookmarks easily. I have been using chrome bookmark manager but sometimes I can't find the bookmark that I'm looking for. Then I often commented on bookmarks and saved them in Slack to remember what bookmark is, but also it's difficult to find it again. Jotdown was born to solve these problems.
