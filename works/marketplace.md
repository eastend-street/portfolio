## What is Mail MarketPlace?

Mail MarketPlace is a mail advertisement trading web application. This was a project I was involved in my former company, bizocean Co., Ltd.
It's designed to sell email inventories by online. Ad buyers are able to search and sort inventories by price, date, type and other conditions.

\* Unfortunately, I couldn't show you the web application due to company rules.

## Technologies

I joined this project from the basic design phase. I developed the Marketplace responsible for all the front end work. Then I wrote backend CRUD processing, and constructed cloud infrastructure environment as well.

- **Front-end:** Vue.js, Vuex, Vuetify.js, Vue Router
