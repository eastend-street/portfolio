## What is Mail MarketPlace?

Mail MarketPlace is a mail advertisement trading web service. This is a project I was involved in my previous company, bizocean Co., Ltd.
It designed to sell email inventory by online. Ad buyers can search and sort inventory by price, date, type and other conditions.

\* Unfortunately, I could not show you the web service due to company rules.
