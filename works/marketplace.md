## What is Mail MarketPlace?

Mail MarketPlace is a mail advertisement trading web application. This was a project I was involved in at my former company.
It's designed to sell email inventories online. Ad buyers are able to search and sort inventories by price, date, type, and other conditions.

\* Unfortunately, I couldn't show you the web application due to company rules.

## Technologies

I joined this project from the basic design phase. I developed the Marketplace responsible for the entire front end. Then I wrote backend CRUD processing and constructed a cloud infrastructure environment as well.

- **Front-end:** Vue.js, Vuex, Vuetify.js and Vue Router
- **Backend:** Django REST framework and Python
- **Infrastructure:** Google Cloud Platform and Docker
- **Others:** REST API, Axios and Gunicorn
