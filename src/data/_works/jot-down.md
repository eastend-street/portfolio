  ## Why I created this app


  To manage a lot of bookmarks easily. I have been using chrome bookmark manager but sometimes I can't find the bookmark that I'm looking for. Then I often commented on bookmarks and saved them in slack to remember what bookmark is. But also difficult to find it again. Jotdown was born to solve these problems.
